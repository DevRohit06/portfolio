# Announcing Lito: Documentation That Developers Actually Love

I've spent a lot of time thinking about documentation tooling. After building [SuperDocs](/blog/superdocs-open-source-documentation) and learning from its strengths and limitations, I wanted to take everything I'd learned and build something better, something that nails the developer experience from day one.

Today, I'm excited to announce **Lito**, an open-source documentation site generator that transforms your Markdown into searchable, beautiful documentation websites. No complex configuration. No framework boilerplate. Just your content and a single command.

## Why Another Documentation Tool?

Fair question. The documentation tool space isn't exactly empty. But after using (and building) several options, I kept running into the same friction points:

- **Too much configuration** before you can write a single line of docs
- **Missing components** that force you to build callouts, tabs, and code groups from scratch
- **Search that requires a server** or a third-party service
- **Theming that's an afterthought** instead of a first-class feature

Lito addresses every one of these. It's the documentation tool I always wanted to use.

## Zero Configuration, Real Results

Getting started with Lito requires exactly one file, a `lito.json` configuration:

```bash
npx lito init
```

That's the entire setup. Lito scaffolds your project, creates sensible defaults, and you're writing docs immediately. No webpack configs. No plugin chains. No build tool archaeology.

The philosophy is simple: **the tool should get out of your way**. You're here to write documentation, not configure a build system.

## 20+ Built-in MDX Components

This is where Lito really shines. Instead of forcing you to build common documentation patterns yourself, Lito ships with over 20 pre-built MDX components:

### Callouts

Highlight important information with semantic callouts:

```mdx
<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure to back up your data before upgrading.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  This feature requires version 2.0 or higher.
</Callout>
```

### Tabs

Present alternative instructions side by side:

```mdx
<Tabs>
  <Tab label="npm">
    npm install lito
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="pnpm">
    pnpm add lito
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="bun">
    bun add lito
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
```

### Code Groups

Show related code snippets together with automatic syntax highlighting:

```mdx
<CodeGroup>
  <Code title="server.ts" language="typescript">
    import express from 'express';
    const app = express();
  </Code>
  <Code title="server.py" language="python">
    from flask import Flask
    app = Flask(__name__)
  </Code>
</CodeGroup>
```

### Cards, Accordions, and More

Steps, cards, accordions, file trees, API reference blocks - Lito has components for every common documentation pattern. No third-party plugins needed.

## Offline Search with Pagefind

One of my biggest frustrations with documentation tools is search. Most solutions either require a server-side search engine (Elasticsearch, Meilisearch) or a third-party service (Algolia DocSearch) that adds complexity and external dependencies.

Lito takes a different approach: **full-text search powered by Pagefind**. It runs entirely in the browser with zero server infrastructure:

- **Builds at compile time**:Search index is generated during the build step
- **Runs offline**:Works without internet after the initial page load
- **Zero cost**:No search service subscriptions
- **Fast**:Pagefind's compressed index format keeps search responsive even for large doc sites

Your users get instant, accurate search results without you maintaining any backend infrastructure.

## OpenAPI Integration

Building API documentation? Lito includes built-in **OpenAPI integration** that generates interactive API reference pages from your spec files:

- Import your `openapi.yaml` or `openapi.json`
- Lito generates browsable, interactive API reference pages
- Request/response examples are rendered automatically
- Try-it-out functionality for testing endpoints

No more maintaining API docs by hand and hoping they stay in sync with your actual API.

## Dual-Theme System

Lito ships with a polished **dual-theme system**:light and dark modes with smooth transitions:

- **System preference detection**:Automatically matches the user's OS theme
- **Manual toggle**:Users can override with a click
- **Smooth transitions**:No jarring flashes when switching themes
- **Custom theming**:Override CSS variables to match your brand

Both themes are designed from the ground up, not just an inverted color scheme bolted on as an afterthought.

## Internationalization (i18n)

Building docs for a global audience? Lito has **built-in i18n support**:

- Define translations per locale
- Automatic language switching in the navigation
- SEO-friendly URL structures per language
- Fallback to default locale for untranslated pages

No external i18n libraries or complex routing configurations needed.

## How Lito Compares

| Feature | Lito | Mintlify | Docusaurus | SuperDocs |
|---------|------|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Setup** | Single JSON | Dashboard | Full scaffold | CLI command |
| **MDX Components** | 20+ built-in | Built-in | Plugin-based | Basic |
| **Search** | Pagefind (offline) | Built-in | Plugin (Algolia) | Built-in |
| **OpenAPI** | Native | Native | Plugin | No |
| **i18n** | Built-in | Built-in | Built-in | Planned |
| **Themes** | Dual + custom | Limited | Customizable | Dark/Light |
| **Pricing** | Free | Paid | Free | Free |
| **Self-Hosted** | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |

### The Evolution from SuperDocs

If you've used SuperDocs, you'll feel right at home with Lito. It builds on the same CLI-first philosophy but takes it further:

- **Richer component library**:20+ components vs. basic Markdown
- **Better search**:Pagefind's offline-first approach vs. basic full-text
- **OpenAPI support**:First-class API documentation
- **i18n**:Multilingual docs out of the box
- **More polished themes**:Production-ready from day one

Think of Lito as SuperDocs grown up, same philosophy, vastly expanded capabilities.

## Quick Start

Ready to try it? Three steps:

```bash
# 1. Initialize a new Lito project
npx lito init

# 2. Start the dev server
npx lito dev

# 3. Build for production
npx lito build
```

Write your docs in Markdown or MDX, use the built-in components, and deploy the static output anywhere: Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, or your own server.

## Open Source and Community-Driven

Lito is fully **open-source** and community-driven:

- **GitHub**: [Lito-docs/cli](https://github.com/Lito-docs/cli)
- **Discord**: Active community for questions and contributions
- **Current Version**: v1.0.0

Contributions are welcome, whether it's new components, bug fixes, documentation improvements, or feature requests.

## What's Next

Lito v1.0.0 is just the beginning. The roadmap includes:

- More MDX components based on community feedback
- Enhanced OpenAPI features (webhook documentation, schema validation)
- Version selector for multi-version documentation
- AI-powered search suggestions
- CLI plugins for custom workflows

## Try It Today

If you've been struggling with documentation tooling - too much configuration, missing components, search headaches - give Lito a try. It's free, open-source, and designed to make documentation something developers actually enjoy writing.

```bash
npx lito init
```

Documentation shouldn't be painful. With Lito, it isn't.
